        The HTML <a> (anchor) tag defines a hyperlink.
              A hyperlink (or link) is a word, group of words, or image that you can  click on to jump to another document.
              When you move the cursor over a link in a Web page, the arrow will turn into a little hand.
              The most important attribute of the &lt;a&gt; element is the href attribute, which indicates the linkâ€™s destination.
              By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
                    1. An unvisited link is underlined and blue.
                    2. A visited link is underlined and purple.
                    3. An active link is underlined and red.
